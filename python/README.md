__About__

Hello, welcome to NOLA CODE's Python portion of the class.  Python is a programming language that's used for many things like data science, hardware, and websites.  I hope you're able to use what you learn in class to solve problems.

__Goals__

- Understand the fundamentals of programming through Python.

- Decompose complicated problems into smaller problems, solve those problems, then combine those for the original solution.

- Apply knowledge to solve relevant real world problems.

- Make the skills you learn in other classes important outside the classroom.

__Labs__

- **Lab 1** - Understanding Cloud9, Linux, and how to get started with Python
