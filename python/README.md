__About__

Hello, welcome to NOLA CODE's Python portion of the class.  Python is a programming language that's used for many things like data science, hardware, and websites.  I hope you're able to use what you learn in class to solve problems.

__Goals__

- Understand the fundamentals of programming through Python

- Decompose complicated problems into smaller problems, solve those problems, then combine those for the original solution

- Apply knowledge to solve relevant real world problems.
