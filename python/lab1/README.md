** Understanding Cloud9, Linux, and how to get started with Python **

Hello, for today's lab you will be familiarizing yourself with the C9 IDE, the *nix command line, and the start of programming with Python.

1. Go to the [C9 Login](https://c9.io/login).  Enter your login information; if you don't have one or have problems, see Mr. Olin.

2. Once you're logged in, you should see something like this:

Since you're just starting out, you'll have an empty workspace.  

3.  Click "Create a New Workspace".  Fill it out as follows:

- ** Workspace Name ** - Python

- ** Description ** - Workspace for Python class

- ** Team ** - Jeff Rise

- ** Hosted Workspace ** - Public

- ** Clone from Git or Mercurial URL ** - (leave blank)

- ** Choose a Template ** - Python
