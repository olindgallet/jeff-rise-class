**Understanding Cloud9, Linux, and how to get started with Python**

Hello, for today's lab you will be familiarizing yourself with the C9 IDE, the Unix command line, and the start of programming with Python.  First, understand that Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE).  Let's break it down -- being cloud-based means that as long as you have your username and password, you can access Cloud9's services from any computer with an Internet connection.  If you want to experiment at home or the library, do so!  Integrated development environment is a place to write code and test programs.  It includes a text processor, a command line, and other features to make programming easier.

Now let's get started.

1. Go to the [C9 Login](https://c9.io/login).  Enter your login information; if you don't have one or have problems, see Mr. Olin.  **Always** keep track of your login and password as this is needed for future classes. 

2. Once you're logged in, you should see something like this:

![workspaces](https://github.com/olindgallet/jeff-rise-class/blob/master/python/lab1/c9workspaces.png)

Since you're just starting out, you'll have an empty workspace.  

3.  Click "Create a New Workspace".  Fill it out as follows:

- **Workspace Name** - Python

- **Description** - Workspace for Python class

- **Team** - Jeff Rise

- **Hosted Workspace** - Public

- **Clone from Git or Mercurial URL** - (leave blank)

- **Choose a Template** - Python

After that, click "Create Workspace" and your workspace will be created.  In the background, a virtual machine is being made.  So why do you need a "computer inside a computer"?  Having a virtual machine means you can run multiple operating systems on one computer; keep in mind some programs only run on certain operating systems (or OSes).

4.  After your virtual machine gets created and finishes loading, you should see somehthing like this:
